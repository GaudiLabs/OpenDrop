### Open Source Digital Microfluidics Bio Lab

OpenDrop is a new open source digital microfludics platform for research purposes. The device uses recent electro-wetting technology to control small droplets of liquids. Potential applications include lab-on-a-chip devices for automating processes of digital biology. However, the present design should also open up the technology to other fields, such as art, music, games, and education. It should also allow experimentation for the purpose of finding new applications.
